Silly app to help my kids decide on a movie.

## Search

Search for kids movies based on title, click to add

## Veto

Kids take turns veto-ing movies, whichever movies is left over at the end we watch ;) ðŸŽ‰

### `.env`

If you want to run this yourself you'll need to add some environment variables:

```
VUE_APP_TMDB_API_KEY={your_api_key}
VUE_APP_POSTER_PATH=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185
```
